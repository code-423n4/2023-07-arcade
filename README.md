# ‚ú® So you want to run an audit

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our audit collaboration.

Your audit will use two repos:
- **an _audit_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your audit and for providing information to wardens
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the audit)

Ultimately, when we launch the audit, this repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for audit participants. The findings repo will be made public after the audit report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the audit sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 24 hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [ ] When linking, please provide all links as full absolute links versus relative links
  - [ ] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [ ] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [ ] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [ ] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [ ] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Review the Gas award pool amount. This can be adjusted up or down, based on your preference - just flag it for Code4rena staff so we can update the pool totals across all comms channels.
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] See also: [this checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

# Overview

[Arcade.xyz](https://docs.arcade.xyz/docs/faq) is a platform for autonomous borrowing, lending, and escrow of NFT collateral on EVM blockchains. This repository contains the contracts for a token-based governance system, which can be granted ownership and management authority over the core lending protocol. This governance system is built on the [Council Framework](https://docs.element.fi/governance-council/council-protocol-overview).

### ___See natspec for technical detail.___

The Arcade governance system's smart contracts can be grouped into the following categories:

- __Voting Vaults__: Depositories for voting tokens in the governance system - see [Council's documentation](https://docs.element.fi/governance-council/council-protocol-overview/voting-vaults) for more general information. Each voting vault contract is a separate deployment, which handles its own deposits and vote-counting mechanisms for those deposits. As described below, the Arcade.xyz uses novel vote-counting mechanisms. Voting vaults also support vote delegation: a critical component of the Council governance system.
- __Core Voting Contracts__: These contracts can be used to submit and vote on proposed governance transactions. When governing a protocol, core voting contracts may either administrate the protocol directly, or may be intermediated by a Timelock contract.
- __Token Distribution__: The ERC20 governance token, along with contracts required for initial deployment and distribution of the token (airdrop contract, initial distributor contract).

# Scope

| Contract | SLOC | Purpose | Libraries used |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [ARCDVestingVault.sol](contracts/ARCDVestingVault.sol) | 384 | A voting vault, designed for early Arcade community members, contributors, and launch partners, that holds tokens in escrow subject to a vesting timeline. Both locked and unlocked tokens held by the vault contribute governance voting power. Since locked tokens are held by the `ARCDVestingVault`, they are not eligible for NFT boosts. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [ArcadeGSCCoreVoting.sol](contracts/ArcadeGSCCoreVoting.sol) | 33 | An instance of Council's `CoreVoting`, set up for use by a GSC. | N/A |
| [ArcadeGSCVault.sol](contracts/ArcadeGSCVault.sol) | 40 | An instance of Council's `GSCVault`, a voting vault contract for a
[Governance Steering Council](https://docs.element.fi/governance-council/council-protocol-overview/governance-steering-council). See Council documentation for more information. | N/A |
| [ArcadeTreasury.sol](contracts/ArcadeTreasury.sol) | 398 | A contract which can receive tokens from the distributor, and transfer or
approve them based on invocations from governance. The GSC may be authorized to spend smaller amounts from their own voting contract: all other amounts must be authorized by full community votes. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [BaseVotingVault.sol](contracts/BaseVotingVault.sol) | 201 | A basic `VotingVault` implementation, with little extension from Council. Defines common query and management interfaces for all voting vaults. Unlike Council, Arcade governance voting vaults are not upgradeable. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [ImmutableVestingVault.sol](contracts/ImmutableVestingVault.sol) | 43 | An instance of the `ARCDVestingVault`, with functionality extended such that `revokeGrant` can not be used. Tokens held in this vault otherwise have the same voting power and liquidity constraints as ones held by `ARCDVestingVault`. | N/A |
| [NFTBoostVault.sol](contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol) | 706 | The core community voting vault for governance: it enables token-weighted vote counting with delegation and an NFT "boost". Token holders can deposit or withdraw into the vault to register voting power, with no liquidity restrictions. Each token deposited represents a unit of voting power. In addition, the NFT boost allows certain ERC1155 assets to receive "multipliers": when users deposit those NFTs, the voting power of their deposited ERC20 tokens are boosted by multiplier. In addition to adding tokens and an NFT at deposit time, both components of the deposit can be managed separately: NFTs can be added, updated, or withdrawn separately, and a user can add or remove tokens from an NFT boosted position.
At any time, governance may update the multiplier value associated with a given NFT. Due to gas constraints, this will not immediately update the voting power of users who are using this NFT for a boost. However, any user's voting power can be updated by any other user via the `updateVotingPower` function - this value will look up the current multiplier of the user's registered NFT and recalculate the boosted voting power. This can be used in cases where obselete boosts may be influencing the outcome of a vote. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [ArcadeAirdrop.sol](contracts/token/ArcadeAirdrop.sol) | 80 | A contract which can receive tokens from the distributor, and release them
for a second distribution according to a merkle tree. Governance may set a merkle root, and users can claim tokens by proving ownership in the tree.
Unclaimed tokens after a set `expiration` time may be reclaimed by governance. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [ArcadeToken.sol](contracts/token/ArcadeToken.sol) | 171 | A standard OpenZeppelin based `ERC20` token, with minting capability.
At deploy time, an initial amount of circulating tokens are minted to a distributor contract (see `ArcadeTokenDistributor`). Governance is given ownership of the token on deployment, and every 365 days, governance may decide to call the `mint` function to mint new tokens. The ability to call `mint` is granted by governance to a single address. When calling `mint`, governance may mint up to 2% of the total supply. After calling, `mint`, it may not be called again for 365 days. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol](contracts/token/ArcadeTokenDistributor.sol) | 180 | A contract which receives the initial circulating supply of token, and will
send tokens to destinations representing distribution according to tokenomics. This may include airdrop contracts or vesting vaults. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [BadgeDescriptor.sol](contracts/nft/BadgeDescriptor.sol) | 62 | Basic descriptor contract for badge NFTs, that uses a baseURI, and returns a tokenURI for the requested token ID. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |
| [ReputationBadge.sol](contracts/nft/ReputationBadge.sol) | 222 |  Reputation badges are ERC1155 tokens that can be minted by users who meets certain criteria. For example, a user who has completed a certain number of tasks can be awarded a badge. The badge can be used in governance to give a multiplier to a user's voting power. Voting power multipliers associated with each tokenId are stored in the governance vault contracts not the badge contract.
This contract uses a merkle trie to determine which users are eligible to mint a badge. Only the manager of the contract can update the merkle roots and claim expirations. Additionally, there is an optional mint price which can be set and claimed by the manager. | [`@openzeppelin/*`](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) |

## Out of scope

* contracts/external/ contain dependency contracts and should not be in scope - think of it as lib/. There were a couple contracts - principally CoreVoting.sol, Timelock.sol and GSCVault.sol - that we integrate with, and having copies of their on-chain code in the repo was useful.

* contracts/test/ contain mock contracts for testing purposes and should not need to be looked at, except obviously within the context of reviewing the tests.

# Additional Context: Privileged Roles & Access

* Vaults derived from the `BaseVotingVault` have two roles:
    * A `manager` role can access operational functions,
        such as calling `setMultiplier` in the `NFTBoostVault`,
        and calling `addGrantAndDelegate` and `revokeGrant`
        in the `ARCDVestingVault`.
    * A `timelock` role can change the `manager`, as well as changing
        its own role to a new timelock. For the `NFTBoostVault`, the
        timelock can eventually choose to allow token withdrawals.
* Core voting contracts have an `owner`, which in a governance
    system should be a timelock that is owned by `CoreVoting` itself:
    such that all updates to `CoreVoting` require passing votes. This
    `owner` is able to change parameters around voting, such as the
    minimum voting power needed to submit a proposal. The same suggested
    ownership architecture applies to `ArcadeGSCCoreVoting`: it should
    have ownership power over a separate timelock, which itself owns
    the voting contract.
* The `ArcadeToken` contract sets a `minter` role, which can mint new tokens
    under certain constraints (see `ArcadeToken` above). The `minter`
    can also transfer the role to another address.
* The `ArcadeAirdrop` contract as an `owner` that can update the merkle root,
    as well as reclaim tokens after airdrop expiry. This should be operationally
    managed by a voting contract.
* The `ArcadeTokenDistributor` contract is owned by an address which can administer
    the distribution. This owner may decide which address receives their reserved
    amount of tokens.
* The `Treasury` contract grants permissions to addresses who are allowed
    to spend tokens. There are separate roles for full spends, which should be granted
    to a community voting contract, and GSC spends, which may be granted to a community
    voting contract. Ownership may also be granted to timelocks owned by the respective
    voting contracts.
