When a user with voting power calls delegate, the address they delegate too will receive all their voting power. So the delegate even without depositing tokens can vote in governance.

[07/22/2023 11:28] 0xjuntao
where in the code the voting power is used? can you kindly point out


[07/22/2023 13:25] powvt
Voting power is used by the Core Voting contract in the external folder. It is used when a user calls `vote`  and when a user creates a proposal. Also in the external folder the GSCVault uses this to see if a user meets the voting power threshold to become a member of the GSC.

[07/22/2023 22:21] aba1842
so, I deleted the checksum directly from the yarn.lock to bypass the check and the package was installed. But When running test it complained about having both `waffle` and `hardhat-chai-matchers`. But hardhat does not work without `hardhat-chai-matchers` (was getting a specific error message) so I removed `waffle` but `waffle` is used in the testing code so I ended up trying to modify the test code to not use `waffle`, where I stopped. 

So I ask, did anybody actually managed to run the tests?


[07/22/2023 22:52] trachev
@em_mutable @PowVT Are contracts that import  "./external/council/libraries/Storage.sol"; intended to be implementation contracts of upgradeable protocols?


[07/23/2023 03:30] 0x11singh99
how do I run only one test file  at a time ?


[07/23/2023 03:33] _3agle
Check the forge test -h docs


[07/23/2023 03:42] immeas
or if it is hardhat you can use `--grep`
```
$ npx hardhat test --grep "Vote Execution with Arcade GSC Vault"
```
as an example


[07/23/2023 03:43] immeas
also works with single tests:
```
$ npx hardhat test --grep "Executes proposal to pause V2 Promissory Notes transfers with an Arcade GSC vote: YES"
```

On both Windows and WSL setups,  `yarn install` was failing on checksum, after removing the checksum for the `"@arcadexyz/v2-contracts@arcadexyz/v2-contracts"` in `yarn.lock` the install was fine.

On running the tests (`npm test`) there was a warning about having both matchers, however the test all executed and passed.

Were you getting tests failing, or refusing to execute?

Then what is the purpose of using the Storage library in ARCDVestingVault? In Storage.sol it says: "// This library allows for secure storage pointers across proxy implementations".


[07/23/2023 09:41] em_mutable
This is an external Council library contract. In their use case, it supports upgrade ability. We are using it for our storage although our contracts are not upgradeable.

you can't go further until you successfully install  dependency package

ok ill try it, you still delete the checksum line right ?


[07/23/2023 13:32] aba1842
something very odd for me regarding this, on a fresh git repo/clone the advice to simply remove the yarn.lock checksum works, but on the one I worked on/notted stuff it fails. Well, I will just use the other one (or copy the nodes_modules directly onto this one)... very very odd

What was the reasoning behind making the `unlock` feature of the NFT Boost Vault non-reversable ?

I see, thank you. Another question, if you can please. What is the intended use case of `ArcadeTreasury::batchCalls`.  The `if (spendThresholds[targets[i]].small != 0) revert T_InvalidTarget(targets[i]);` check imposes quite a strict limitation


[07/23/2023 19:21] viktor_cortess
Hello guys, registration.withdrawn means amount that was withdrawn before or the amount that is left to withdraw? i.e. if registration.amount = 100, I withdraw 30, then registration.withdrawn = 30?


[07/23/2023 19:38] aba1842
yes, it does. Thank you again, very much!


[07/23/2023 19:39] powvt
This is correct, the withdraw amount helps with accounting. It helps us calculate a user's current vopting power. See here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-arcade/blob/f8ac4e7c4fdea559b73d9dd5606f618d4e6c73cd/contracts/NFTBoostVault.sol#L630


[07/24/2023 01:25] powvt
Sorry I misspoke in my original reply here. That check is so that people do not circumvent the spend thresholds put in place. If the token has a spend limit then it cannot also be used to make external calls. This function is more intended to be used for things like uniswap swaps, compound etc... things where governance wants to participate in other protocols with the tokens held in the treasury.

Can anyone explain the concept of cliff in arcade vesting contract


[07/24/2023 09:25] _3agle
In the context of vesting contracts, a "cliff" refers to a specific period of time that must pass before any vested tokens or assets become accessible. During the cliff period, no tokens or assets are unlocked or available for the recipient.

Typically, vesting contracts have a cliff period to ensure that the recipient remains committed to the project or organization for a certain duration before gaining access to their vested tokens. It acts as a form of lock-up period or probationary period.

Once the cliff period is over, the vesting schedule begins, and a portion of the tokens or assets becomes accessible at regular intervals until the grant or vesting period ends.

The cliff period is defined by specifying a block number or a specific duration of time in the vesting contract. It is important to note that during the cliff period, no tokens are unlocked, and the recipient does not have access to them.

The purpose of the cliff period is to align the interests of the recipient with the project or organization and incentivize long-term commitment.

{Reactions}
thankyou (3) 

[07/24/2023 09:49] noro9954

[07/24/2023 12:58] powvt
Yes user has voting power even if their cliff has not been reached.


[07/24/2023 12:58] powvt
Yeah it takes a couple of mins to run


[07/24/2023 13:00] powvt
Not in scope, but if you find a exploit that would be detrimental to governance operations or the expected operation of these contracts the submission will definitely be considered.

Please would someone be kind enough to explain, in vestingvault delegate function, in the first push call (line 268) - why is there a difference between oldDelegateeVotes and grant.latestVotingPower?


[07/25/2023 21:45] osmanozdemir1
As my understanding, delegatee might have voting power from a lot of users.

If a user wants to delegate someone new, that user‚Äôs old delegatee will lose that amount of voting power and the new delegatee will get that

üíØ 

[07/25/2023 21:57] 0xJimbo#2687
I guess what I‚Äôm trying to understand is what votingPower.loadTop(grant.delegatee); represents & what grant.latestVotingPower represents. In my head I‚Äôm expecting them to be the same figure, but obviously they aren‚Äôt


[07/25/2023 22:00] osmanozdemir1
I believe Grant A, grant B, grant C etc they all can have the same delegatee. 

votingPower.loadTop(grant.delegatee) will result all the sum of the voting powers which has the same delegatee but grant.latestVotingPower is only one grant‚Äôs power

They should only be able to deposit on NFT into the NFTBoostVault at a time. There is a function updateNft where they can swap out their current NFT with a new one

In what scenario do you envisage updateVotingPower in NFTBoostVault to be used?


[07/26/2023 22:13] powvt
A contract manager can update the NFT multiplier being used. So this function can basically sync it with the new voting power. Otherwise it would be very gas intensive to update all users with that badge's voting power if this op was performed when the multiplier is updated.

Understood. Thank you!

In what scenarios do users  use their votingPower ? @PowVT


[07/27/2023 05:54] _3agle
The voting power from all approved vaults such as `NFTBoostVault` or `ARCDVestingVault` is used in the governance (i.e. `/external/CoreVoting.sol`, `ArcadeGSCCoreVoting`)

Hello, I have a question about scope details. For example `ArcadeAirdrop.sol` is in scope, but inherits from `ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol` which is not in scope. Whether we should audit `ArcadeMerkleRewards.sol`?

not c4/arcade staff, but here's a similar finding that could potentially could shed some light

unless "ArcadeMerkleRewards" kind of "forces" ArcadeAirdrop.sol to implement vulnerable code, its gonna be OOS

Hello, I haven't noticed a module to cast votes, is it out of scope?


[07/27/2023 12:14] _3agle
Yes, it's OOS. Votes can be cast in `external/CoreVoting::vote`

You can't wait until 2 mins prior to close. You'll get caught 95% of the time. We have to honor the cutoff period.

before adding polygon to my metamask extension, should that effect anything ? cause I didnt receive anything yet


[08/22/2023 16:00] mrpotatomagic
have you imported the USDC contract address on polygon network?


[08/22/2023 16:01] mrpotatomagic
if not, your USDC will not reflect in metamask

Switch to your polygon network and there must be an import tokens option at the bottom
